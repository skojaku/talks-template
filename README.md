# Talks template

This repository contains a template for creating and organizing talks. It provides a structured format to help you prepare and present your ideas effectively.


## Structure 

The template is organized into the following sections:

- Black theme: `template/black-theme.key` 
- White theme: `template/white-theme.key`

The figures and assets used in the slides are stored in the `assets` folder.

The memo and notes for the talks are stored in the `notes` folder.


## Talk Preparation Checklist

### Phase 1: Planning and Narrative
- [ ] Define the single "Idea" (cargo) the audience should take home
- [ ] Model your audience (knowledge level, mood, variance)
- [ ] Set slide budget (1 slide per minute)
- [ ] Structure narrative: tell them what you'll tell them → tell them → summarize
- [ ] Identify your puzzle or "Aha!" moment

### Phase 2: Slide Design
- [ ] Use widescreen aspect ratio
- [ ] Ensure no small fonts
- [ ] Check: every figure is explained (axes, data)
- [ ] Check: every equation is explained or removed
- [ ] Use "vertical/horizontal" instead of "X/Y axis"
- [ ] Maintain consistent visual theme
- [ ] Add mini-figures to conclusion slide for recall

### Phase 3: Practice and Refinement
- [ ] Script the story for each slide
- [ ] Plan every transition (know what to say before clicking)
- [ ] Rehearse with video recording
- [ ] Time yourself rigorously
- [ ] Present to a friend and apply feedback
- [ ] Iterate: make slides → rehearse → edit → repeat

### Phase 4: Delivery (Game Day)
- [ ] Prepare PDF backup accessible via URL
- [ ] Practice pauses and enthusiasm ("turn up to 11")
- [ ] Plan exit strategy if running over time
- [ ] Pre-talk: breathe, review transitions
- [ ] Always use microphone
- [ ] Keep lights on
- [ ] No laser pointer
- [ ] Respect time limit strictly
- [ ] Post-talk: self-debrief
