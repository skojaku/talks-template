# Talks template

This repository contains a template for creating and organizing talks. It provides a structured format to help you prepare and present your ideas effectively.


## Structure 

The template is organized into the following sections:

- Black theme: `template/black-theme.key` 
- White theme: `template/white-theme.key`

The figures and assets used in the slides are stored in the `assets` folder.

The memo and notes for the talks are stored in the `notes` folder.


## Get Started

- [ ] Identify the time limit for your talk
- [ ] Identify the audience for you talk 
- [ ] Create a mind map of your talk's key message and narrative 
- [ ] Flatten the map into a linear sequence of points
- [ ] Sketch out main slides 
- [ ] Create the first version of your slides 
- [ ] Go through a rehearsal, identify the points that stumble you, without timing
- [ ] Split and merge slides to improve flow
- [ ] Rehearse again, time yourself, put a clock icon on slides to remind you to check the time
- [ ] Finalize slides, check for consistency in fonts, colors, and layout
